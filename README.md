2. Ensure you have the latest version of **qBittorrent** installed.

## Proxy/VPN

You can get free premium proxies from [webshare.io]([https://webshare.io/](https://www.webshare.io/?referral_code=je4m1m2hbz3i)) and use them for proxy configuration. Configure it in `proxy.txt` as follows:

```plaintext
PROXY_HOST = 'p.webshare.io'
PROXY_PORT = 80
PROXY_USER = 'pbgbttrk-rotate'
PROXY_PASS = 'h2oktfdte1oh'
```
this is mine use ur own credentials for the better result
**VPN**
These days, you may use VPN programs like Windscribe. If you don't want to configure a proxy, simply say no when the program asks. It's simple to use, and I believe that using a VPN is faster than using a proxy. Still, it's best to use what you want.
